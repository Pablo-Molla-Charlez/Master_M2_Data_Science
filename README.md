# Master's in Data Science Projects Repository

This repository is a structured archive of my projects and assignments completed during my second year Master's M2 in Data Science. Each directory corresponds to a specific course module and contains relevant notebooks, python scripts, and summaries.

## Directory Structure

- `Algorithms_for_Data_Science`: Theory and Jupyter Notebooks of the most important algorithms used in Data Science.
- `Semantic_Web_&_Ontologies`: Theory and exercises related to the **Semantic Web** and **Ontologies**, providing a solid understanding of foundational concepts and reasoning tasks.
- `Signal_Processing`: Jupyter Notebooks with solved exercises and clearly explained theory, covering fundamental concepts and techniques in **Signal Processing**.
- `Optimization`: Materials and solved exercises covering optimization techniques, algorithms, and applications in data science.
- `Web_of_Data`: Projects and theory related to Linked Data and Web of Data, focusing on integration, querying, and semantic representation of information on the web.
- `Social_Graph_&_Data_Management`: Analysis of social networks, graph theory, and community detection. Includes exercises on modularity, spreading phenomena, probabilistic graphs, and influence algorithms.
- `Communication`: Materials related to the theory and practice of communication within the context of data science, including techniques for presenting data insights.
- `Constraints_&_Data_Mining`: Theory and exercises on constraint satisfaction problems and their applications in data mining.
- `Interactive_Information_Visualization`: Projects focused on creating interactive visualizations to represent data and insights effectively.
- `Knowledge_Discovery_Graph_Data`: Exercises and theory related to knowledge discovery using graph-based data structures and algorithms.
