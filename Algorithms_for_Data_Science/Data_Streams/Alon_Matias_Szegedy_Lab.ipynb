    "- We obtained as true second moment 400,114. This is the exact sum of the squares of the frequencies of the distinct items in the stream and it serves as a reference point for evaluating the accuracy of the AMS estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 $\\underline{\\text{Estimation Results}}$:\n",
    "- Estimation of 2nd moment with $ k = 10 $: 514,000\n",
    "- Estimation of 2nd moment with $ k = 50 $: 395,600\n",
    "- Estimation of 2nd moment with $ k = 100 $: 393,200\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 $\\underline{\\text{Observations}}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3.1 $\\underline{\\text{Impact of Sample Size k}}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - As expected, the accuracy of the AMS estimator improves as $k$ (the number of samples) increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - With a $\\textcolor{red}{\\text{small sample size k = 10}}$, the estimate is **514,000**, which $\\textcolor{red}{\\text{deviates significantly from the true second moment}}$ of **400,114** (about $\\textcolor{red}{\\text{28\\% higher}}$ than the true value). This reflects the $\\textcolor{red}{\\text{high variability}}$ in estimates when fewer samples are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For $\\textcolor{orange}{\\text{k = 50}}$, the estimate of **395,600** is $\\textcolor{orange}{\\text{much closer to the true value}}$ (a $\\textcolor{orange}{\\text{deviation of only 1.1\\%}}$), suggesting that the algorithm is working well as the sample size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - With $\\textcolor{green}{\\text{k = 100}}$, the estimate of **393,200** is as well close to the true second moment (a $\\textcolor{green}{\\text{deviation of 1.7\\%}}$, showing that a larger sample size further improves the precision of the estimate, though the $\\textcolor{orange}{\\text{improvement between k = 50}}$ is slightly better.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3.2 $\\underline{\\text{Variability in Smaller Samples}}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The large difference for $\\textcolor{red}{\\text{k = 10}}$ highlights the randomness inherent in the reservoir sampling technique when only a few samples are taken. $\\textcolor{red}{\\text{With k = 10}}$, the AMS algorithm has fewer opportunities to track the distribution of frequencies accurately, leading to $\\textcolor{red}{\\text{more variability and less precision}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - With $\\textcolor{green}{\\text{larger k values like k = 50 and k = 100}}$, the sample is better able to capture the distribution of elements in the stream, leading to $\\textcolor{green}{\\text{more accurate estimates}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3.3 $\\underline{\\text{Trade-off between Memory and Accuracy}}$:\n",
    "   - $\\fbox{Memory}$: The value of $k$ directly determines how much memory the AMS algorithm uses, as it needs to store $k$ sampled values and their counts. $\\textcolor{orange}{\\text{Larger k values provide better estimates but require more memory}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - $\\fbox{Accuracy}$: As seen in the results, the $\\textcolor{orange}{\\text{estimate becomes more accurate as k increases}}$. This illustrates the trade-off: using more memory (larger $k$) improves the accuracy of the estimate, $\\textcolor{orange}{\\text{but with diminishing returns beyond a certain point}}$ (e.g., the small improvement from $k = 50$ to $k = 100$).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3.4 $\\underline{\\text{Asymptotic Behavior}}$:\n",
    "   - In theory, as $k$ approaches infinity, the AMS estimate will converge to the true second moment. In practice, increasing $k$ from $50$ to $100$ produces only a marginal improvement, suggesting that beyond a certain threshold, $\\textcolor{red}{\\text{the gains in accuracy may not justify the additional memory cost}}$.\n"
